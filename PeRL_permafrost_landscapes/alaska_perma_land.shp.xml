This map represents the final revisions that were made in December 2008.  This is the third iteration of a permafrost map for Alaska, following the circum-arctic permafrost map (Brown et al. 1997), which made minor modifications to the initial map by Ferrians (1965).    Permafrost zones underlie 80% of Alaska, including continuous  (32%), discontinuous (31%), sporadic (8%), and isolated (10%) permafrost.  Glaciers and ice sheets occupy 4% of the area.  The permafrost map is coded with surficial geology, mean annual air temperature (MAAT), primary soil texture, permafrost extent, ground ice volume, and primary thermokarst landforms.

Original surficial geology compiled from hand delineations on 1:250,000 USGS topo maps.  Significant horizontal errors (1-3kms) can be found when compared with ortho corrected imagery (see process description-FGDC metadata view).  Interpret data at a scale appropriate to state-wide mapping and assessment.

Significant horizontal errors (1-3kms) can be found when compared with ortho corrected imagery (see process description).  Interpret data at a scale appropriate to state-wide mapping and assessment.</purpose><supplinf>To map permafrost, the authors developed a rule-based model that incorporated mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) from the PRISM climate map and the surficial geology map of Karlstrom et al. (1964). We used terrain permafrost relationships developed by Kreig and Reger (1982) and our knowledge of permafrost distribution to assign permafrost characteristics to each surficial deposit under varying temperatures.         

Surficial geology greatly affects permafrost characteristics because of differences in topography, soil texture (which affects moisture and thermal properties) and hydrology (surface-water and groundwater).  The authors modified the surficial geology map (Karlstrom, et.al., 1964) to update some areas with new information (e.g., eolian loess and sand, and glaciomarine deposits).         

The map focuses on the top 10 m of permafrost, where permafrost can be more readily mapped from surface features, determined by simple field measurements, and where ground ice usually is most abundant. Distribution of permafrost shown on the map is therefore also based on our knowledge about the presence or absence of permafrost within the upper 10 m. Although MAAT was used in our rule-based model, we note that permafrost distribution is greatly affected by past climates.   

Sources for permafrost thickness values included: MacCarthy (1952), Brewer (1958), Ferrians (1965), Péwé (1975), Osterkamp and Payne (1981), Lachenbruch et al. (1987), and Collett et al. (1989). Depths were determined by temperature logging or interpretation of ice-bearing permafrost from geophysical data. Southerly sites are included when the presence of permafrost is evident even if permafrost thicknesses were not determined.          

The distribution of ice wedges was determined from the literature, from polygonal patterns evident on remote sensing imagery, and from our field experience. Ice wedges actively form mainly in the continuous permafrost zone, and are inactive to weakly active in the discontinuous zone (Péwé, 1975). Holocene ice wedges, which are limited to the top 3-5 m of permafrost, are smaller than large, deep (up to 35 m) syngenetic ice wedges formed during the Late Pleistocene. Symbols for abundant ice wedges denote general locations, whereas, symbols for sparse Holocene and Late Pleistocene wedges indicate specific areas, though distribution remains poorly known.        

Thermokarst landforms are abundant in all permafrost zones (Jorgenson et al. 2008). They are varied, due to differences in temperature, ground ice volume, soil texture, slope, and hydrologic conditions. Abundance of thermokarst is difficult to map because of the wide range in size of features from small pits to large lakes, and similar landforms may have different origin.          

Many improvements are needed for a better permafrost map, including: a surficial geology map with updated information and better spatial accuracy; more information of terrain/ground ice/temperature/permafrost relationships, more temperature boreholes, and improved spatial models.

Corner tics were etched on the mylar overlays with a rapidiograph pen. Utilizing a light table, the Qcode extents, indicated by the colored polygons on the hard-copy maps, were traced onto the mylar overlays with rapidiograph pens. Intersecting latitude/longitude tics were indicated and labeled for reference. The resultant inked mylar overlays were scanned and output into TIF format Utilizing the SRV software package, the linework was autovectorized. After vectorization, the linework was imported and the file was attributed. The coverages provided by NPS contained tics that represented real world coordinate values. The new coverages were transformed into the provided coverages. The project specification dictated that the NPS provided coverages supercede the older data set in cases of conflict (e.g., differing coastline features.) "Qcode" attributes were assigned; utilizing the ARC/INFO software package QC Plots were created for each individual map. Visual quality assurance was conducted by overlaying each plot on the corresponding geologic maps. The separate coverages were edgematched and dissolved into one coverage. NPS received interim checkplots and digital data for internal QC. Final edits were performed at contractor facility. Final digital quality assurance was conducted., Report was finalized and surficial geology product was produced for NPS.  To map permafrost, we developed a rule-based model that incorporated mean annual air temperatures (MAAT) from the PRISM climate map and the surficial geology map. We used terrain permafrost relationships developed by Kreig and Reger (1982) and our knowledge of permafrost distribution to assign permafrost characteristics to each surficial deposit under varying temperatures.

terrain-unit approach for mapping permafrost distribution and based on climate and surficial geology was presented in conjunction with the Ninth International Conference on Permafrost held at the University of Alaska, June 29 to July 3, 2008. This map represents the final revisions that were made in December 2008.   This is the third iteration of a permafrost map for Alaska, following the circum-arctic permafrost map (Brown et al. 1997), which made minor modifications to the initial map by Ferrians (1965).    Permafrost zones underlie 80% of Alaska, including continuous  (32%), discontinuous (31%), sporadic (8%), and isolated (10%) permafrost.  Glaciers and ice sheets occupy 4% of the area.  We coded the permafrost map with surficial geology, MAAT, primary soil texture, permafrost extent, ground ice volume, and primary thermokarst landforms.</idAbs><tpCat><TopicCatCd value="008"></TopicCatCd></tpCat><dataExt><geoEle><GeoBndBox esriExtentType="search"><exTypeCode Sync="TRUE">1</exTypeCode><westBL Sync="TRUE">-173.481508</westBL><eastBL Sync="TRUE">-132.613012</eastBL><northBL Sync="TRUE">73.835824</northBL><southBL Sync="TRUE">54.504612</southBL></GeoBndBox></geoEle></dataExt></dataIdInfo><mdLang><languageCode Sync="TRUE" value="eng"></languageCode><countryCode value="USA" Sync="TRUE"></countryCode></mdLang><mdStanName Sync="TRUE">ISO 19115 Geographic Information - Metadata</mdStanName><mdStanVer Sync="TRUE">DIS_ESRI1.0</mdStanVer><mdChar><CharSetCd Sync="TRUE" value="004"></CharSetCd></mdChar><mdHrLv><ScopeCd Sync="TRUE" value="005"></ScopeCd></mdHrLv><mdHrLvName Sync="TRUE">dataset</mdHrLvName><distInfo><distributor><distorTran><onLineSrc><orDesc Sync="TRUE">002</orDesc><linkage Sync="TRUE">file://\\GEOGRAPH-1D2F3D\F\torredata\Permafrost_AK_2008_AlbAK83.shp</linkage><protocol Sync="TRUE">Local Area Network</protocol></onLineSrc><transSize Sync="TRUE">15.673</transSize></distorTran><distorFormat><formatName>ESRI data format, dependent upon request</formatName><formatVer>9.3</formatVer></distorFormat><distorCont><rpOrgName>Alaska Ecoscience</rpOrgName><rpIndName>Torre Jorgenson</rpIndName><rpPosName>Lead</rpPosName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress><delPoint>2332 Cordes Way</delPoint><city>Fairbanks</city><adminArea>Alaska</adminArea><postCode>99709</postCode><eMailAdd>ecosience@alaska.net</eMailAdd></cntAddress><cntPhone><voiceNum>Please contact us via email.</voiceNum><faxNum></faxNum></cntPhone></rpCntInfo><role><RoleCd value="005"></RoleCd></role></distorCont></distributor><distFormat><formatName Sync="TRUE">Shapefile</formatName></distFormat><distTranOps><transSize Sync="TRUE">7.616</transSize></distTranOps></distInfo><refSysInfo><RefSystem><refSysID><identCode Sync="TRUE" code="102017">NAD_1983_Alaska_Albers</identCode><idCodeSpace Sync="TRUE">Esri</idCodeSpace><idVersion Sync="TRUE">4.0.0</idVersion></refSysID></RefSystem></refSysInfo><spatRepInfo><VectSpatRep><geometObjs Name="alaska_perma_land"><geoObjTyp><GeoObjTypCd value="002" Sync="TRUE"></GeoObjTypCd></geoObjTyp><geoObjCnt Sync="TRUE">8991</geoObjCnt></geometObjs><topLvl><TopoLevCd value="001" Sync="TRUE"></TopoLevCd></topLvl></VectSpatRep></spatRepInfo><mdContact><rpOrgName>Alaska Ecoscience</rpOrgName><rpIndName>Torre Jorgenson</rpIndName><rpPosName>Lead</rpPosName><rpCntInfo><cntAddress><delPoint>2332 Cordes Way</delPoint><city>Fairbanks</city><adminArea>Alaska</adminArea><postCode>99709</postCode><eMailAdd>ecosience@alaska.net</eMailAdd></cntAddress><cntPhone><voiceNum>Please contact us via email.</voiceNum><faxNum></faxNum></cntPhone></rpCntInfo><role><RoleCd value="007"></RoleCd></role></mdContact></metadata>
